# Tracker-Smokes_Mike_Bummed
Script to keep track of how many smokes my co-worker has bummed. 

Details:
For the last 2 months or so, one of my co-workers has been bumming smokes off me every single day. 

"How many smokes a day?" you ask?

About 6± a day, every day, for the last 2 months. 

He hasn't bought a single pack. Sure he pays me back, but the last time he gave me anything was probably after a month of bumming smokes, and he only gave me $10 (a pack of smokes here are about $12). I didn't think anything about it then because it hasn't bothered me yet... But then he bought his FIRST pack of smokes. Plus, we both started a new job at a new place. That means we have to go an extra week without getting paid (pay checks here are usually bị weekly (payday every 2 weeks), but there's that 1 week processing period. So we get paid for working weeks 1 and 2 at the end of week 3. Basically, we were both  broker than usual, going through the same situation, so we both we trying to be understanding. At least I was. 


The morning started like every other morning:  I'd walk into the office, get settled in, walk outside to get ready, and he'd ask me for a smoke... But this time it was different! This time he told me that he would go buy his own pack during the break! 

... Ok.. Does this mean that I can start bumming smokes off of him for the next few weeks? 

Is that what he meant by saying he was going to buy his own pack later on? Or did he mean that he was going to have his own pack, so he wouldn't have have to bum smokes any more? We'll see... 

So lunch came, he went and bought his own pack, just like he said he would. But I still had smokes so I didn't ask him for any. Mid next day though, I ran out and when I asked him for a smoke, he ran out. I thought that he would still have some because he left his pack of smokes at work, but he was out by the middle of the day because he gave smokes back to everyone he bummed smokes from... Everyone but me. 

Obviously, he thought that the $10 that he gave me was enough to cover all the smokes that be grabbed off of me. But at 5 smokes a day, 5 working days a week, that would be 25 smokes a week. And to make the math easier to calculate, let's just say a smoke costs me $0.50. To support my coworker's smoking habit, I have to give him 25 smokes a week, which is 125 smokes a month. And at $0.50 a smoke, that's $62.50 a month.

But he only gave me $10.00, so he either thinks that he doesn't bum that many smokes, or he doesn't think that it's a big deal. 

So I made this little script, which doesn't need to be executed with any extra options or arguments. All I need to do is make a shortcut to the script somewhere on my phone's home screen, where it will sit and act as a widget. Then, when he bums a smoke off of me, I'll just hit the icon for the shortcut, and the script will log the time and date into the log book, and increase the total number of smokes bummed by 1, save all the values, and then exit. 

The next time the script is executed, it will load all the stored values, log log the time and date, increase the total count, save, and exit.
